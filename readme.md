Free free to ask me _anything_! It could be related to anything. If it's not too much personal, I will try to answer.


### Guidelines

- :mag: Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- :clipboard: Use a succinct title and description.
- :bug: Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- :+1: Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- :smiley: Be nice, civil and polite.
